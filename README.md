## FAQ
**How quickly can my music get into stores?**
It varies by distributor, but most platforms can get your release live in a few days to two weeks. Services like LANDR and DistroKid are known for particularly fast turnaround times, sometimes in just 1â€“2 days.

**Do I keep the rights to my music?**
Yes, with all the reputable distributors listed, you retain 100% of your ownership rights and master recordings. These services act as a pipeline to digital stores, not as a traditional label that takes ownership.

**What's the difference between an annual fee and a per-release model?**
An annual fee allows for unlimited releases for a flat yearly cost, which is ideal for prolific artists. A per-release model, like CD Baby's, charges for each single or album you distribute, which can be more cost-effective for those who release music infrequently.

## Conclusion
Choosing the right digital music distribution service is a foundational step in your independent music career. By evaluating factors like pricing, store network, and additional features, you can find a platform that aligns perfectly with your goals. For artists seeking an integrated solution that combines powerful production tools with straightforward distribution, **[LANDR](https://www.landr.com)** stands out as an excellent choice for managing the entire creative process, from the initial idea to the final release.
